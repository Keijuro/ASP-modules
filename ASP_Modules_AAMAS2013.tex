% This is "aamas2012 .tex" August 2012 
% This file should be compiled with "aamas2012 .cls" 
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'aamas2012 .cls'
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to AAMAS 2012  conference. This file is based on
% the sig-alternate.tex example file.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file of ACM will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
% than the original style ACM style.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with AAMAS data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'aamas2012 .cls' you don't have control
% from within the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the IFAAMAS Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% These information will be overwritten by fixed AAMAS 2012  information
% in the style files - it is NOT as you are used with ACM style files.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% This is the document class for full camera ready papers and extended abstracts repsectively

% In the original styles from ACM, you would have needed to
% add meta-info here. This is not necessary for AAMAS 2012  as
% the complete copyright information is generated by the cls-files.


\title{Representing Agent Reasoning with ASP Modules}

% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%

\numberofauthors{3}

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
	In this work, we focus on multi-agent systems in dynamic environment.
	Our interest is about individual agent reasoning in such environment.
	For reasoning in dynamic environment, an agent needs to be able to manage his knowledge in a non-monotonic way.
	To complete his observations, an agent can use abduction to produce hypotheses and refines them with the help of other agents. 
	To reach his goals in a changing environment, an agent needs some capacities like adaptability.
	Our objective is to define a method which makes easier to design agent knowledge and reasoning in such environment.
	We use the expressivity of answer set programming to represent agent knowledge.
	To design agent reasoning, we propose a method based on ASP modules.
	We also propose a framework to implement and use this method in multi-agent systems.
